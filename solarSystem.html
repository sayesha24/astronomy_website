        <h3>What Is A Solar System?</h3>
      
        <p>Solar system is a collection of planets orbiting around the sun, which is the primary forci. 
            The gravitational energy of the planets and the sun is what that leads them to orbit the sun. 
            When, we didn't have the ability to actually see the order of the planets and the sturcture of the solar system, our ancestors tried 
            to predict how the solar system would have looked like. There were two models created which suggested the main foci of the solar system - 
            The Heliocentric Model and The Geocentric model.
            Today, we follow The Heliocentric Model as it recommends that the sun is at the center of the solar system, whereas, 
            as the name suggests, The Geocentric Model stated that the Earth was at the center of the solar system. 
            (Read the webpage - History Of Astronomy for more details). 
            <br> The Solar System consists of 8 planets that include - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

            <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system with a diameter of just 4,876 kilometers, which is almost the size of continental United States. 
                This diminutive planet is the closest to the sun. 
                It takes the least time to orbit around the Sun of just 87.97 Earth days, thus, a year on Mercury would consist of only 87.97 days.
                Mercury possesses water, ice and organics and it's atmosphere changes with its distance to the Sun. </p>

            <h3>Venus</h3>

            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. 
                It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty
            It has diameter of about 12103.6 km.
            One day on Venus is equal to 243 Earth days, therefore, one day is 5,832 hours long.
            Venus is the second brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon.

            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to contain life. 
                The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing. There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth.
                The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System. 
                About 71% of the Earth's surface is made up of water.

            <h3>Mars</h3>
            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System.
                Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet"
                Mars has 2 moons called Deimos and Phobos. Mars is smaller than Earth with a diameter of 4217 miles. 
                Today, Mars has frozen water, but earlier it had flowing water.

            <h3>Jupiter</h3>
            <p>

                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
                 It has a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly 
                 less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
                 Additionally, it is the fastest spinning planet in the Solar System and 
                 has an extremely strong magnetic field that is 14 times stronger than the magnetic field of the Earth.
                 Jupiter also has The Great Red Spot which is 350 to 500 kilometres deep and produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph).

            <h3>Saturn</h3>

            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System.
                Saturn is over 95 times more massive than Earth. It is the flattest plane.
                It's best known for the bright, beautiful rings that circle its equator consisting of 
                countless particles of ice and rock that each orbit Saturn independently.
                It owns 82 moons. Fifty-three moons are confirmed and named
                 and another 29 moons are awaiting confirmation of discovery and official naming.
