        <p> Black holes are one of the most fascinating celestial objects. 
            Everyone, especially children, see it as a giant monster who is always hungry, thus, keeps swallowing stuff.
        
           <br><br> But did you ever want to know more about black holes and how they are observed by astronomers?

        <h3>What Are Black Holes</h3>
        <p>Black holes are regions which possess a very strong gravitational force, that no particle or light can escape from it. 
            Such a high gravitational force is formed as a black hole contains a great amount of matter packed into a very small area, 
            it’s like a star 10 times the sun has been squeezed to a very small area which results to a very strong gravitational energy.
            The density of a black hole is so high that it cannot even be measured.

        <h3>Structure Of A Black Hole</h3>
        <p>

            There are three main regions in a black hole - the Singularity, the Event Horizon and the Erogsphere. 
        </p> 
            
            <p><b><u>The Singularity:</b> </u>
                
                <br>It is a point which has a very high density at the centre. The size is infinite that it essentially has infinite density. 
            <br><br> 
            
            <b><u>The Event Horizon:</u> </b>
            
            <br>It is the centre of the black hole, also known as the point of no return. Here, the escape velocity is equal to the speed of the light. 
            So the velocity of the object must be greater than the velocity of light, which currently is nearly impossible.

            <br><br>

            <u><b>The Erogsphere: </u></b>
            
            <br>It is the region outside/surrounding the event horizon where the gravitational pull begins to influence the motion of an object.

        <h3>Types Of Black Holes</h3>

        <p>There are 4 kinds of black holes:</p>

        <p>

        

        <b><u>Steller Black Hole:</u></b> <br>
        These kind of black holes are formed by individual stars but they are very dense. 
        They are about 5 – 10 times the solar masses. 
        Therefore, they have a high gravitational force. 
        Furthermore, that gravitational force helps them attract more dust and gas which keeps them growing in size.

        </p>

        <a href="#"><img src="blackholeImages/stellar.jpg" width="500"/></a>

        <p> <b><u>Supermassive Black Hole:</u></b><br>
            
            These black holes dominate the whole universe. 
            They are billions or millions of times as massive as the sun but have the same diameter. 
            Additionally, they are thought to be lying in the centre of almost every galaxy even in our galaxy, sounds frightening right?
            Their high gravitational force allows them to attract great amounts of dust and gas which helps them attain even more enormous sizes. 
            Also, they may be a result of tiny black holes merging. Or large gas clouds collapsing together. Or collapse of a stellar cluster which is a group of stars collapsing/ dying together

           <b> <u>Intermediate Black Holes:</u></b><br>

            Recent research has revealed the possibility of these blackholes. 
            They have a range of mass between 102 – 105 solar masses.
            These bodies form when stars in a cluster collide.
            Also, if there are several intermediate blackholes forming in the same region then there are possibilities to fall together at the centre of the galaxy and hence create an enormous blackhole. 
            Additionally, in 2018, a report suggested that intermediate blackholes are usually found in dwarf galaxies.
A report also revealed the presence of blackholes from 36000 – 316000 solar masses. 
The Sloan digital sky survey was used to obtain this information. To do so, they detected the kind of light coming from the surrounding objects around the blackhole as those objects were throwing the light back. This helped them examine how massive the blackhole is.

 <b><u>Miniature Black Holes:</u></b><br>

These black holes are also known as quantum mechanical black holes or micro black holes as they are very tiny in size. 
The possibility of such tiny black holes that are smaller than 1 stellar mass was introduced by Stephan Hawking in 1971.
They are thought to be created during the big bang wherein there was a high density environment.

        <h3>How Are Black Holes Observed</h3>

        <p> 

            Astronomers determine whether there is a black hole in a particular region through examining the stars by using a telescope that is put up in the atmosphere. 
            They see if stars are orbiting or flying around a black hole, because when a black hole and a star are close to each other, they produce high energy light which can only be seen through telescopes.
            This can aware us about whether there is a black hole near our solar system and study more about black holes. 
            Unfortunately, there will be a day we will wake up and find ourselves inside the giant black hole, just kidding!
            Earth cannot be swallowed by a black hole because there is no black hole near our solar system as of now.
Also, if a black hole replaces the sun, then too the planets won’t be lost in the black hole because that black hole will most probably have the same gravitational force as the sun which will keep the planets to orbit around it.
Additionally, the sun won’t turn in to a black hole as it is not big enough to do so.

        <h3>Facts About Black Holes</h3>

        <p>
            
-	If one was pulled inside a black hole then that person would be stretched like noodles.
<br>
-	If stars are passing a black hole too closely then the star can be torn apart. 
<br>
-	It is estimated that in the milky way there are about 10 million – 1 billion stellar black holes with masses about 3 times of the sun.
